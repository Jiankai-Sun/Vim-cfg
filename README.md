Configuration for Vim

### Requirements
- Ubuntu 18.04 x64
- Vim >= 7.4, e.g. `vim-nox-py2`, the Vim which support python2
- [Vundle, the plug-in manager for Vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
- `sudo apt install cmake python-dev`
### How to use
- Install `Vundle` as [Quick Start](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim#quick-start) but replace the `.vimrc` (Vundle) with the `.vimrc` file in this repo. Put the `.vimrc` file under `$HOME` directory. (Note: `vim +PluginInstall +qall` is better)
